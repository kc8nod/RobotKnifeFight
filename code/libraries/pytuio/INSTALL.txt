To install pytuio, run the following command inside this directory:

    python setup.py install

Or if you'd prefer you can simply place the included ``tuio``
directory somewhere on your Python path, or symlink to it from
somewhere on your Python path; this is useful if you're working from a
Subversion checkout.

If you plan to use this library together with Nodebox.app please copy the 
``tuio`` directory (create it if needed) to ~/Library/Applications
Support/Nodebox/

Note that this application requires Python 2.3 or later, and a recent
version of reacTIVision. You can obtain Python from http://www.python.org/
and reacTIVision from http://reactable.iua.upf.edu/?software.
